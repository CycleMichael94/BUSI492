# BUSI492
Files and projects pertaining to my BUSI 492 directed study.

As I learn I am starting with the basics and allowing the project to guide my learning.
The end goal is to automate a simple DCF valuation using downloaded data.

For 'readexcel.py', 'readwriteexcel.py', and 'readwriteinputexcel.py':
At first I just implemented reading, then writing, then merged those with user 
inputs to write user information to a csv file. This was to get comfortable with 
using python the manipulate data.

For 'financialpull.py':
I implemented the iexfinance package to request information endpoints and used the Pandas package
to easily read and write to excel files. Python3 can nativelly support CSV files but the other
benefits of Pandas make it worth it to learn.
