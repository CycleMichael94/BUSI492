# BUSI492
Files and projects pertaining to my BUSI 492 directed study.

As I learn I am starting with the basics and allowing the project to guide my learning.
The end goal is to automate a simple DCF valuation using downloaded data.

At first I just implemented reading, then writing, then merged those with user 
inputs to write user information to a csv file.
